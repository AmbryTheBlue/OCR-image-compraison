	resize
par0 = fx a zaroven fy ; scale factor along the horizontal and vertical axis; size multiplier in resize; double

denoise
par1  = h (Parameter regulating filter strength.) Big h value perfectly removes noise but also removes image details, smaller h value preserves details but also preserves some noise
par2 = search_window Size in pixels of the window that is used to compute weighted average for given pixel. Should be odd. Affect performance linearly: greater search_window - greater denoising time. Recommended value 21 pixels
par3 = block_size	Size in pixels of the template patch that is used to compute weights. Should be odd. Recommended value 7 pixels

blur
par4 = rozmery kerenelu v .blur
blur-bilateral
par5 = d -diametr
par6 = sigmaColor
par7 = sigmaSpace
blur-gauss
par8 = rozmer-kerenlu, must be odd
par9 = standartni deviace, je-li 0,automaticky se dopocitava
blur-median
par10 = kerenel size, odd > 1
